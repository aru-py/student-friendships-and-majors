    "Model performances were just shy of the baselines, with the Neural Network outperforming all the models for the first dataset, but coming in second to K-Nearest Neighbors for the second dataset. Surprisingly, the least flexible model, Logistic Regression, came second to last, only performing better than Decision Trees. The models possibly underperformed due to unobserved factors, including social ones such as membership in a sports team or organization, which may have taken precedence over major in influencing one’s best friends, as well as biases in the data itself, as Venmo is increasingly being used to pay strangers. Collectively, these factors form the irreducible error, which limits how well these models can approximate the true friendships-student-major relationship."
